## Machine Learning
### 1. ShapeAI - A tool that generates a large synthetic dataset of basic geometric shapes and leverages this data to train to predictive models. 


## Data Science (Analytics, Econometrics)
### 1. The Productivity Effects of Foreign Ownership in Laos - Undergraduate Dissertation; achieved First Class (Highest Honours)
  `summary`: I used panel data and econometric methods (fixed effects, IV, and matching) to estimate how foreign ownership affects firm productivity and to address endogeneity through multiple robustness checks.
  
  `code`: https://github.com/quentinbkk/Laos_Productivity/blob/main/B202054.do

  `final draft`: https://github.com/quentinbkk/Laos_Productivity/blob/main/Final%20Dissertation%20Quentin.pdf

  `data`: World Bank Enterprise Survey (https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/enterprisesurveys)

  `outcomes`: The analysis showed a consistent and statistically significant productivity premium for foreign-owned firms, even after addressing endogeneity with IV and matching approaches. It also highlighted how sensitive empirical results can be to model specification, reinforcing the importance of robustness checks in applied econometrics.
  
### Analysis of AMZN Stock Returns (2020-2025) - Financial Econometrics Project; achieved highest grade in class (86%, class average: 60%)

  `summary`: This project applies time-series econometrics to analyse Amazon’s stock using five years of daily data (2020–2025). The analysis investigates stylised facts of financial returns, tests market efficiency, builds volatility-forecasting models (ARMA/ARCH/GARCH), constructs an ex-ante 5-day forecast, performs Monte-Carlo simulations, and conducts an event study around Amazon’s 2021 CEO transition. It also includes a pairs-trading simulation using a cointegrated synthetic competitor stock.

  `final draft`: https://github.com/quentinbkk/Amazon-AFE-Project--First-Repository-/blob/main/AFE%20Written%20Component.pdf

  `data`: Daily AMZN price data from Orbis; S&P500 returns for market-model estimation; simulated data for pairs-trading section.

  `outcomes`: The analysis found that Amazon’s stock returns exhibit classic financial time-series features—volatility clustering, heavy tails, and high persistence in volatility—best captured by a GARCH(1,1) model, with Monte-Carlo simulations confirming these dynamics. Tests supported the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the event study showed no significant abnormal returns around the 2021 CEO transition, and the pairs-trading exercise demonstrated cointegration with the synthetic comparator stock.
